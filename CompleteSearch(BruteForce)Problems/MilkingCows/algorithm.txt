problem spec: the problem statement is specified in the problem.txt file.

My solution:
-Read in the times from the input file.
-Create a new class "MilkingSchedule".
-Give all the times to the milking schedule class.
-Iterate through the pairs of times.
-If the next pair has a start time before the end of the previous pair, add the difference between the ends to the current time counter.
-Once you find a pair that the start time is after the previous pairs end time, compare the current time counter with the longest so far, if it's greater store it.
-If the next pair has a start time after the end time, find the difference and compare it to your longest non-milking time counter, if it's greater store it.
-Once done iterating, output the date to a file as specified in the problem statement.
