problem: as specified in problem.txt

algorithm:
read in the input, store the length and the string.
iterate through the string from left to right.
have a counter, a max beads variable, max position variable.
as you iterate, count the number of contiguous same coloured beads (including white).
When this ends, keep counting with the next colour.
When the next colours ends, check if the counter is greater than the current max beads variable.
if it is store ,store counter in max beads.
iterate back until you find the first opposite colour. if the previous condition was met, store this location in max_loc.    
go back some more if the previous beads are white.
Repeat the last 6 steps until you reach the end of the string.
At this point you should have the maximum, output this.
