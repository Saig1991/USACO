problem: as specified in problem.txt

algorithm:
read in the input, store the length and the string.
iterate through the string from left to right.
have a counter,break variable, a max beads variable, max position variable.
as you iterate, count the number of contiguous same coloured beads (including white).
When this ends, keep counting with the next colour, storing the break in the break variable.
When you the next colours ends, check if the counter is greater than the current max beads variable.
if it is store break in max position, store counter in max beads.
Repeat the last 4 steps until you reach the end of the string.
At this point you should have the maximum, output this.
