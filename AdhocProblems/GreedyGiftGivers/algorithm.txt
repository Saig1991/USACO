problem statement specified in the problem.txt

My solution (C++):
First run through the list of names, creating a map from name to number(starting from 0).i.e. in counting order
initialise two array of 0s of length equivalent to the number of people in the group.
one array will contain the inital money that each person had.
the other will contain the final amount of money.
iterate through the NP Groups of lines.
Store the initial amount of money in the respectives persons spot(check the map) in the initial money array.
For the person with the money, mod the money with the number of people it's divided by and add this number to the final money array.
Then divide the money by the number of people and add this number to each persons final money array.
Once you've iterated through all the people, output the difference between the final money array and the initial money array.
