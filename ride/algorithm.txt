My solution (C++):
Read in both the words.
Use a string stream to break up the words into there constituent characters.
Subtract the Ascii number for A from the letters (since all are capitols as specified in the spec) then add 1 to this number. (A = 1)
Iterate through and multiply the numbers.
Mod this number by 47.
Check if the two numbers are equal.
